# Web Scraper for Product Details
This Python project is a simple web scraper that uses `BeautifulSoup` to extract product information, such as product titles and prices, 
from a website. The script is currently set up to extract data from headings (`h2`) and spans (`span`) with specific class names.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use this project, make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` using pip:

```
 pip install beautifulsoup4 requests 
```

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```
 git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

3. Open the file and specify the URL and the HTML structure you want to parse. For example:
```
 url = "https://example.com"
```

5. Run the script:
```
Product Name
$49.99
```

> [!NOTE]
> This script is intended for demonstration and educational purposes only.
> Be mindful of the site's terms of service before scraping data, as some websites prohibit data scraping.
